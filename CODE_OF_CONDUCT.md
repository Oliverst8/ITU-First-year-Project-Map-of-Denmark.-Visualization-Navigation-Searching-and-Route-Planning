# Goals

We are going to create a map over Denmark in the form of a program using Java. We want to create a program that works reasonably well. At the same time we want to improve our coding skills and learn to work efficiently in a group.

We want to be able to be proud of the program at the end of the project. This means that we want to fulfill the requirements of the project and strive to get a good grade.

# Work hours

## Primary work days

On the primary work days we will meet up at the university and work together. We will also have a meeting at the start of the day to discuss what we are going to do that day. The meeting is not going to be longer than 15 minutes.

- Tuesday | 08:00 - 16:00
- Thursday | 10:00 - 16:00

If a team member is unable to attend the primary work days, they are expected to inform the rest of the team.

## Off days

Every team member is allowed to work on the project on their own time. If disired, the span from 12:00 to 16:00 on mondays is a way to work together on the project.

# Decision making

## Decisions regarding how a given feature should be implemented.

If a decision is to be made, we will take it up in the group. Either at the next meeting or on Discord, depending on the urgency of the decision.

## Conflict resolution

We value the ability to talk to each other and resolve conflicts in a civil manner. If a conflict arises, we will try to resolve it by talking to each other. If that does not work, we will take it up with the conveyor in the group.
